Project Analysis:

Target User Profile: This page will be viewed basically by managers of companies that want to know which are my qualities and strenghts to be able to decide if they want
to contract me. I believe those persons would want concrete and formal information, knowing my experience, my studies, my qualities and my personal information. 
I also believe that adding some indentifing details to the page that make a unique impact is important to create a differents to other candidates to get the work.

Information Architecture: This web only has one page that is structured with a header, two columns (one small one that has contact information and basic skills, and the 
big one with the main content of the page), and ends with a footer. 

Visual design: Because this is a curriculum, i believe that the presentation of it has to be formal. That's why i have decided to use black colour in the margins of the
page and the header and footer. I also decided to keep the default text font (Times New Roman) with the exeption of the big titles that are in Arial. I also liked to 
create the layout with two columns because I thougth that would be a good idea to diferenciate the content of the page in function of the rellevancy of it. I also added 
some emojis, and other details to make the page a little bit more eye-catchy without removing its formality. I also added a quote that I created myself that kinda 
explains how I live in a day a day basis.
